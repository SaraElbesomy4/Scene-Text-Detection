# Scene-Text-Detection
This is the final project of Computer vision Course in UST-ZC (CIE 552). In this project I implement the CPTN model that is presented in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03605)(Detecting Text in Natural Image with Connectionist Text Proposal Network). 

Firstly, I implemented the paper on the dataset which the authors have used: [ICDAR 2015](https://deepai.org/dataset/icdar-2015). Then, I tested the same model (CPTN) on more challenging dataset: [Total-Text-Dataset](https://github.com/cs-chan/Total-Text-Dataset/tree/master/Groundtruth/Text).  

To know all the details in my implementation approach, you can read [Scene Text Detection.pdf](https://github.com/SaraElbesomy4/Scene-Text-Detection/blob/main/Scene%20Text%20Detection.pdf) 

### To run the test code: 

- Change the paths in the following files :

1. config.py

2. Scene text Detection

3. Testing CTPN model on ICDAR 2015 dataset

- Make the new paths according to you pc.


### The available notebooks:


1.Scenc Text Detection - Test Pretrained Model on Test data.ipynb

use the pretrained model on Total text data.

2.Testing CPTN Model on ICDAR 2015 Dataset.ipynb

use the pretrained model on its original data (ICDAR 2015).
