# Scene-Text-Detection
This is the final project of Computer vision Course in UST-ZC (CIE 552). In this project I implement the CPTN model that is presented in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03605)(Detecting Text in Natural Image with Connectionist Text Proposal Network). 

Firstly, I implemented the paper on the dataset which the authors have used: [ICDAR 2015](https://deepai.org/dataset/icdar-2015). Then, I tested the same model (CPTN) on more challenging dataset: [Total-Text-Dataset](https://github.com/cs-chan/Total-Text-Dataset/tree/master/Groundtruth/Text).  

To know all the details in my implementation approach, you can read [Scene Text Detection.pdf](https://github.com/SaraElbesomy4/Scene-Text-Detection/blob/main/Scene%20Text%20Detection.pdf) 

To run the test code: 

change the paths in the following files :

1. config.py

2.Scene text Detection

3.Testing CTPN model on ICDAR 2015 dataset

make the new paths according to you pc.


My written code:


1.Scene Text Detection

use the pretrained model on my data.

2.Testing CTPN model on ICDAR 2015 dataset

use the pretrained model on its original data.
